sh404sef extension for com_os_cck_2.5.4_pro
------------------------------------------------

Tested with Joomla 3.7.1, CCK 2.5.4 Pro, sh404SEF 4.8.2.3492

Installation:
-------------
In the folder /components/com_os_cck create a subfolder sef_ext, like this
/components/com_os_cck/sef_ext

Now using FTP or similar, drop the file com_os_cck.php into that sef_ext directory.

In the sh404SEF control panel, go to the [By Component] tab and set Os_cck to [Do not override] 

Now you have very nice SEF URL's for CCK in the frontend.
